      Hi! I'm Vinnie and I'm a
      <span class="highlight">software developer based in Victoria, BC</span>.
      <br><br>
      This is my dev journal, a place where I document my journey as a software
      developer and store the things I have learned along the way. It serves as
      a reference for me to easily access the knowledge and experiences I have
      gained in the past. It is not a blog, but a personal repository of
      information and I hope it will be a valuable resource for me in the
      future.
